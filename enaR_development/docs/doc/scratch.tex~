The network approach has been quite useful in ecosystem ecology, in
which many core questions center on how species are connected across
the intricate web of interactions.  Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA)
has been successfully used to address a range of questions.  For
example, \citet{bondavalli1999} found evidence of an indirect
mutualism between the American alligator and several of its prey items
in the Big Cypress National Preserve (Florida, USA) including several
invertebrates, frogs, and small mammals.
