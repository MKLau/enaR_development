The results are summarized using a histogram showing the distribution of the values of each network statistic between the observed minimum and maximum values. The median, mean, and coefficient of variation (ratio of standard deviation and mean) values are also reported. The network statistics are the number of nodes ($n$), the connectance ($C = L/n^2$), link density ($LD = L/n$), pathway proliferation rate (lam1A), Finn cycling index (FCI), average path length (APL), indirect flow intensity (IFI), output oriented network homogenization ratio (HMG.O), output-oriented network amplification ratio (AMP.O), average mutual information (AMI), the ascendency-to-capacity ratio (ASC.CAP), flow-based network synergism (synergism.F) and mutualism (mutualism.F).}}{21}{figure.2}
