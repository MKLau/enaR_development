Thank you very much for the rapid and organized review of the
manuscript. We found all of the comments to be constructive and
helpful, making for a significantly improved manuscript. As we detail
below, we have addressed all suggested edits per the reviewer's
instructions.

*Reviewer 1*

Comments to the Corresponding Author
- I think that "Network Ecology" should be "network ecology"

We agree with the reviewer here and have changed to the lower case, as
it network ecology is now an established, general field of study and
not a specific study, i.e., a proper noun, and thus doesn't warrant
capitalization. 

- Please provide the comparison with other software as supplementary
  material

Great suggestion. We have added a table comparing the
output of functions from enaR to the output from several other ENA
analytical packages, including NETWRK, Ecopath and WAND.

- I have made some minor queries on the code, submitted as GitHub
  issues

This was very helpful and kind of the reviewer. We have gone through
all of the suggestions and fixed them as suggested.

*Reviewer 2*
- I question the need for the section “Example Application” in the
  manuscript. This seems better suited to a helpfile than to a
  manuscript.

This is a good suggestion; however it conflicted with the
recommendation of the associate editor. As a compromise we have
updated the text to make it more streamlined and changed the
associated table to a clearer figure.

- I wonder whether there is a way of expressing the idea in line 153
  without appearing to advertise for the program. I believe the
  manuscript should be a description of a program, not a sales pitch
  for it. My suggestion is to look out for this across the entire
  manuscript. I appreciate that the authors have tried to be clearer
  about the novelty of the program and its usefulness, and that this
  may be the manner in which they have chosen to do so.

We appreciated this suggestion, as our intent is to illustrate the
utility of the package for users and draw their attention to the
possible benefits. We have adjusted areas to reduce the
"advertisement" language, especially any buzz-words.

- Table 4 is not actually a table and additionally text in it, though
  useful to package users, is not sufficiently important to warrant
  inclusion in the manuscript. I suggest eliminating it from the
  manuscript and making it accessible via the package helpfiles, if it
  isn’t already.

We agree that Table 4 overlaps with content provided in the help
files. As a part of the general streamlining of example presentation,
as previously mentioned, we have made it into a figure.

- Caption 1d. Is it actually meant to read “xx node” or is this an oversight?

This was a very good catch. We have fixed it to now read "56 node."

- Table 3, are there really no example references for the other
  functions (e.g. for calculation of eigenvalue centrality of a
  matrix)? For cases in which there are no relevant references, I
  suggest for the purposes of standardising with other tables that the
  authors place the word “none” in the respective row.

This was a very good question from the reviewer. Most of these
functions don't have references as they are functions specific to the
package. 

%%%% Stuart - enaCentrality references?

- The use of the phrase “note that” seems inappropriately colloquial
  for a manuscript. See lines 101 and 118. I suggest a re-write. See
  also “notice” in line 191.

We have reduced colloquial language throughout the manuscript.

- Line 118, typo: space required between “enaR” and “to”.
- Line 119, typo: correct “softare”.
- Line 197, typo: correct “enhancment”
- Line 222, typo: correct “exiting”
- Line 240, grammatical inconsistency: “cycles is”
- Line 244, typo: correct “enhancement”
- Table 3, typo in last row, second column.

We have corrected all typos pointed out by the reviewers and editors.
