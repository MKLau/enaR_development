Network analysis is a useful approach for complex, relational
  datasets in many biological fields, including ecology and molecular
  and evolutionary biology.
Here, we introduce \enaR , an \R\ package for conducting
  Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA), an analytical tool set rooted in
  ecosystem ecology with over 30 years of development, which examines
  the structure and dynamics of matter and energy movement between
  discrete ecological compartments (e.g., a food web).
In addition to describing the primary functionality of the
  package, we also highlight several value added features including a
  library of 100 empirical ecosystem models, the ability to analyze
  and compare multiple models simultaneously, and connections to
  useful ecological network analysis tools in \R .
