Network analysis is a useful approach for investigating complex and relational
  datasets in many fields including ecology, molecular,
  and evolutionary biology.

Here, we introduce enaR, an R package for applying Ecosystem Network
  Analysis (ENA) to ecosystem models.  ENA is an analytical tool set
  rooted in ecosystem ecology with over 30 years of development that 
  examines the structure and dynamics of matter and energy movement
  between discrete ecological compartments (e.g., a food web).

In
  addition to describing the primary functionality of the package, we
  highlight several value added features including a library of
  100 empirical ecosystem models, the ability to analyze and compare
  multiple models simultaneously, and connections to useful ecological
  network analysis tools in \R .
