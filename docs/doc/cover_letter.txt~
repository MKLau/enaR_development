We have done our best to address all comments made by the associate
editor and reviewers. 

There are multiple comments to focus and clarify the introduction. In
order to make the introduction both more inteligible and relevant to
an ecological audience, we have added more text to make the ecological
interpretation of the presented analyses clearer. We have also removed
the text discussing the network analysis "schools" from the intro and
now present it later in the manuscript. In addition, we focused the
text and reduced the overall length introduction be removing any
unecessary details. 

It was also suggested that we improve the clarity of how the package
is to be used and extended by the community. With the goal of
improving the pedagogy of the manuscript, we have added more
ecological interpretation to the example analysis text and annotation
in the example, i.e., Table 4, which we have updated so that it is now
completely reproducible. The ecological interpretation of the example
Flow Analysis is now presented in a paragraph added to the Example
Application sub-section. The previously difficult to access,
supplementary data file, oyster.dat, is no longer referred to for the
example. Text clarifying the data requirements and inputs, model
library contents, batch processing, visualizations, and links to other
packages has also been added to those respective sub-sections or
figure legends. Missing references in the description of the example
results have also been added.

We have also extended the description of the package as a whole and
the specific functions with Tables 1, 2 and 3. In addition, Github
repository information has been added to the text, which provide
further information on how users can contribute to the package and
view code directly with all annotation visible in the code for each
function. The text stating that the package is "built on" existing
packages has been improved to explain that the package uses a data
type that is used with previously developed packages used for network
analyses. We have also added text describing the input data types and
methods, partly through Tables 1 through 3. Confusing text referring
to the package as professional grade has now been removed. Version
numbering issues have been removed by deleting specific reference to
the version of the package.
