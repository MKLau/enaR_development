\Abstract{
  Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) provides a framework for
  investigating the structure, function and dynamics of ecological
  systems, primarily ecosystem models with physcially conserved
  units. Here, we present the \textit{enaR} package, which provides a
  broad representation of many of the core tools developed by the ENA
  community, detailing how to use the primary functions of the package
  for the analysis of single models or simultaneous, synthetic
  analysis of multiple ecosystem models.

This package is a collection of functions to implement Ecological
Network Analysis (ENA), which is a family of algorithms for
investigating the structure and function of ecosystems modeled as
networks of thermodynamically conserved energy--matter exchanges.  The
package brings together multiple ENA algorithms from several
approaches into one common software framework that is readily available and
extensible.  The package builds on the \textit{network} data structure
for \R\ developed by \citet{butts08_network}. In addition to being
able to perform several types of ENA with a single package, users can
also make use of network analysis tools built into the
\textit{network} package, the \textit{sna} (social network analysis)
package \citep{butts08_social}, and other components of what is now
called \textit{statnet} \citep{handcock2008statnet}.

This vignette illustrates how to use the \textit{enaR} package to
perform ENA.  It is not meant to be a detailed guide to ENA, but we
provide some references to the primary literature for those wishing to
learn more about the techniques.
