To the editor of the Journal of Statistical Software,

We are pleased to submit an manuscript for a JoSS Article that
provides a guide to Ecosystem Network Analysis using the enaR software
package. Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) addresses analytical needs
for investigations of complex ecological systems primarily drawing
from the mathematics developed in the field network theory. ENA has a
long history in ecology and lies at the roots of multiple core topics:
such as the determinants of biodiversity and the factors determining
the cycling of nutrients, like nitrogen. In addition to
its direct analytical applications, the enaR package serves to collect
a number of analytical algorithms that have previously developed on
separate research trajectories, and having them together provides a
great opportunity for the synthesis of the underlying theory.

In closing, we thank you for considering our manuscript for
publication in JoSS. We look forward to receiving your response.

Sincerely,


Matt Lau, Stuart Borrett and Pawandeep Sing
